O tempo de penalização, referentes ao item 10.2, será aplicado\n\t\t\t\t\tdiretamente ao tempo total do piloto na bateria e a posição será calculada\n\t\t\t\t\tapós o acréscimo do tempo.\n\t\t\t\t</h5>\n\t\t\t\t<h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t11.5. Os pontos de penalização, referentes ao item 10.3, serão aplicados\n\t\t\t\t\tdiretamente à pontuação geral do piloto, ou seja, não serão aplicados\n\t\t\t\t\tdiretamente à pontuação da corrida.

O piloto que desrespeitar seu companheiro, funcionários, membros da\n\t\t\t\t\torganização ou qualquer outra pessoa, terá sua ação avaliada pela\n\t\t\t\t\torganização do evento e poderá sofrer sanções, que variam desde uma\n\t\t\t\t\tadvertência até a expulsão do evento.\n\t\t\t\t</h5>\n\t\t\t\t<h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t11.7.

Os membros da Comissão Organizadora que estiverem competindo em\n\t\t\t\t\talguma bateria são considerados “apenas” pilotos e, portanto, estão\n\t\t\t\t\tsusceptíveis às mesmas regras e punições da competição.\n\t\t\t\t\t11.11. A organização é soberana para decidir a penalização que será aplicada em\n\t\t\t\t\tcasos não previstos neste regulamento, podendo consultar o Diretor de\n\t\t\t\t\tProvas, Comissários de Pista, Fiscais de Pista e até mesmo os pilotos para\n\t\t\t\t\tchegar a uma conclusão.\n\t\t\t\t</h5>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>12.
