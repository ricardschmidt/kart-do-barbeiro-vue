Esta será\n\t\t\t\t\tdevidamente descontada da restituição a ser feita por parte\n\t\t\t\t\tda organização do evento, caso desista de participar do evento\n\t\t\t\t\tem questão, seja por qualquer motivo. Caso o cancelamento\n\t\t\t\t\tseja realizado dentro do prazo legal previsto no art. 49 da\n\t\t\t\t\tLei nº 8078/90, ou seja, em até 7 dias da data da inscrição,\n\t\t\t\t\ta restituição dos valores pagos será integral, nos moldes do\n\t\t\t\t\tparágrafo único do mesmo artigo de lei.\n\t\t\t\t</h5>\n\t\t\t\t<h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t14.2. Considerando que o piloto teria um grande prejuízo caso OS\n\t\t\t\t\tORGANIZADORES desistissem de fazer o evento, entendemos que os\n\t\t\t\t\tORGANIZADORES também têm prejuízos quando um piloto desiste de\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipar do mesmo evento.\n\t\t\t\t</h5>\n\t\t\t\t<h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t14.3.

Outrossim, considerando que os fornecedores são pagos com\n\t\t\t\t\tantecedência de até 72 horas ou mais da data do evento, não serão\n\t\t\t\t\trealizadas devoluções dos valores pagos para desistências realizadas fora\n\t\t\t\t\tdo prazo legal acima mencionado.\n\t\t\t\t</h5>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>15.
